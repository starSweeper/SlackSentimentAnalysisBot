	<title>SSA BOT Authorization</title>
</head>
<body>
	The SSA Bot is a tool to help you keep a channel or group chat on topic. It uses the Slack API and a little machine learning to 
	determine who in the group is making the most work related posts, the most "semi" work related posts, and the most off topic posts.
	Once a week the SSA Bot will release a ranking of the top contributers in each catagory. This tool is meant for fun and to help keep
	slack messages productive. It is not meant to be used to disipline employees.
